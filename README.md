Simple LLM Inference on CPU and finetuning and RAG of LLM Model to create a Custom Chatbot
Note:<BR>
1. The code for finetuning was initialized on Intel Tiber Developer Cloud and may need to be personalized for other platforms.<br>
2. The datasets are customized and generated by us and may not be available at any other sources.<br>

Description:<br>
1. Created Custom Chatbot via Finetuning and RAG techniques on Llama3 LLM with 8b parameters on CPU inference.<br>
2. Deployed the RAG model using Streamlit framework and Finetuned model on Intel Tiber Developer Cloud.<br>
3. Performed performance analysis of RAG model on 3 different systems.<br>
